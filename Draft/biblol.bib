abstract = {Book Description Other volumes in the Wiley Series in Probability and Mathematical Statistics Abstract Inference UIf Grenander The traditional setting of statistical inference is when both sample space and parameter space are finite dimensional Euclidean spaces or subjects of such spaces. During the last decades, however, a theory has been developed that allows the sample space to be some abstract space. More recently, mathematical techniquesespecially the method of sieveshave been constructed to enable inferences to be made in abstract parameter spaces. This work began with the authors 1950 monograph on inference in stochastic processes (for general sample space) and with the sieve methodology (for general parameter space) that the author and his co-workers at Brown University developed in the 1970s. Both of these cases are studied in this volume, which is the first comprehensive treatment of the subject. 1980 Order Statistics, 2nd Ed. Herbert A. David Presents up-to-date coverage of the theory and applications of ordered random variables and their functions. Develops the distribution theory of order statistics systematically, and treats short-cut methods, robust estimation, life testing, reliability, and extreme-value theory. Applications include procedures for the treatment of outliers and other data analysis techniques. Provides extensive references to the literature and the tables contained therein. Exercises included. 1980 Theory and Applications of Stochastic Differential Equations Zeev Schuss Presents SDE theory through its applications in the physical sciences, e.g., the description of chemical reactions, solid state diffusion and electrical conductivity, population genetics, filtering problems in communication theory, etc. Introduces the stochastic calculus in a simple way, presupposing only basic analysis and probability theory. Shows the role of first passage times and exit distributions in modeling physical phenomena. Introduces analytical methods in order to obtain information on probabilistic quantities such as moments and distribution of first passage times and transition probabilities, and demonstrates the role of partial differential equations. Methods include singular perturbation techniques, old and new asymptotic methods, and boundary layer theory. 1980 Download Description The first systematic, book-length treatment of the subject. Begins with a general introduction and the formal mathematical background behind qualitative and quantitative robustness. Stresses concepts. Provides selected numerical algorithms for computing robust estimates, as well as convergence proofs. Tables contain quantitative robustness information for a variety of estimates.},

In this article, we propose a novel data-analytic tool, sliced inverse regression (SIR), for reducing the dimension of the input variable x without going through any parametric or nonparametric model-fitting process. This method explores the simplicity of the inverse view of regression; that is, instead of regressing the univariate output variable y against the multivariate x, we regress x against y. Forward regression and inverse regression are connected by a theorem that motivates this method. The theoretical properties of SIR are investigated under a model of the form, y = f(? 1 x, ?, ?

In fact, the ? k 's themselves are not identifiable without a specific structural form on f. Our main theorem shows that under a suitable condition, if the distribution of x has been standardized to have the zero mean and the identity covariance, the inverse regression curve, E(x | y), will fall into the e.d.r. space. Hence a principal component analysis on the covariance matrix for the estimated inverse regression curve can be conducted to locate its main orientation, yielding our estimates for e.d.r. directions. Furthermore, we use a simple step function to estimate the inverse regression curve. No complicated smoothing is needed. SIR can be easily implemented on personal computers.

abstract = {We develop a face recognition algorithm which is insensitive to
large variation in lighting direction and facial expression. Taking a
pattern classification approach, we consider each pixel in an image as a
coordinate in a high-dimensional space. We take advantage of the
observation that the images of a particular face, under varying
illumination but fixed pose, lie in a 3D linear subspace of the high
dimensional image space-if the face is a Lambertian surface without
shadowing. However, since faces are not truly Lambertian surfaces and do
indeed produce self-shadowing, images will deviate from this linear
subspace. Rather than explicitly modeling this deviation, we linearly
project the image into a subspace in a manner which discounts those
regions of the face with large deviation. Our projection method is based
on Fisher's linear discriminant and produces well separated classes in a
low-dimensional subspace, even under severe variation in lighting and
facial expressions. The eigenface technique, another method based on
linearly projecting the image space to a low dimensional subspace, has
similar computational requirements. Yet, extensive experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed \&amp;ldquo;Fisherface\&amp;rdquo; method has error
rates that are lower than those of the eigenface technique for tests on
the Harvard and Yale face databases},

abstract = {The spatial receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian striate cortex have been reasonably well described physiologically and can be characterized as being localized, oriented, and bandpass, comparable with the basis functions of wavelet transforms. Previously, we have shown that these receptive field properties may be accounted for in terms of astrategy for producing asparse distribution of output activity in response to natural images. Here, in addition to describing this work in a more expansive fashion, we examine the neurobiological implications of sparsecoding. Of particular interest is the case when the code is overcomplete—i.e., when the number of code elements is greater than the effective dimensionality of the input space. Because the basis functions are non-orthogonal and not linearly independent of each other, sparsifying the code will recruit only those basis functions necessary for representing a given input, and so the input-output function will deviate from being purely linear. These deviations from linearity provide a potential explanation for the weak forms of non-linearity observed in the response properties of cortical simple cells, and they further make predictions about the expected interactions among units in response to naturalistic stimuli.},

A familiar example is factor analysis, which is based on a linear transformation between the latent space and the data space. In this article, we introduce a form of nonlinear latent variable model called the generative topographic mapping, for which the parameters of the model can be determined using the expectation-maximization algorithm. GTM provides a principled alternative to the widely used self-organizing map (SOM) of Kohonen (1982) and overcomes most of the significant limitations of the SOM.

Its objective is to find h observations (out of n) whose covariance matrix has the lowest determinant. Until now, applications of the MCD were hampered by the computation time of existing algorithms, which were limited to a few hundred objects in a few dimensions. We discuss two important applications of larger size, one about a production process at Philips with n = 677 objects and p = 9 variables, and a dataset from astronomy with n = 137,256 objects and p = 27 variables. To deal with such problems we have developed a new algorithm for the MCD, called FAST-MCD. The basic ideas are an inequality involving order statistics and determinants, and techniques which we call “selective iteration” and “nested extensions.” For small datasets, FAST-MCD typically finds the exact MCD, whereas for larger datasets it gives more accurate results than existing algorithms and is faster by orders...},

abstract = {Many areas of science depend on exploratory data analysis and visualization. The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},

abstract = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs-30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10(6) optic nerve fibers-a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

We illustrate our algorithm using curves and surfaces both in two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2D/3D) Euclidean spaces and in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces.

The IRE has at least three desirable properties: (1) Its estimated basis of the central dimension reduction subspace is asymptotically efficient, (2) its test statistic for dimension has an asymptotic chi-squared distribution, and (3) it provides a chi-squared test of the conditional independence hypothesis that the response is independent of a selected subset of predictors given the remaining predictors. Current methods like sliced inverse regression belong to a suboptimal class of the IR family. Comparisons of these methods are reported through simulation studies.

Some transductive graph learning algorithms and standard methods including support vector machines and regularized least squares can be obtained as special cases. We use properties of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to prove new Representer theorems that provide theoretical basis for the algorithms. As a result (in contrast to purely graph-based approaches) we obtain a natural out-of-sample extension to novel examples and so are able to handle both transductive and truly semi-supervised settings. We present experimental evidence suggesting that our semi-supervised algorithms are able to use unlabeled data effectively. Finally we have a brief discussion of unsupervised and fully supervised learning within our general framework. Keywords:},

abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.

abstract = {In important application fields today-genomics and proteomics are examples-selecting a small subset of useful features is crucial for success of Linear Classification Analysis. We study feature selection by thresholding of feature Z-scores and introduce a principle of threshold selection, based on the notion of higher criticism (HC). For i = 1, 2, ..., p, let pi(i) denote the two-sided P-value associated with the ith feature Z-score and pi((i)) denote the ith order statistic of the collection of P-values. The HC threshold is the absolute Z-score corresponding to the P-value maximizing the HC objective (i/p - pi((i)))/sqrt\{i/p(1-i/p)\}. We consider a rare/weak (RW) feature model, where the fraction of useful features is small and the useful features are each too weak to be of much use on their own. HC thresholding (HCT) has interesting behavior in this setting, with an intimate link between maximizing the HC objective and minimizing the error rate of the designed classifier, and very different behavior from popular threshold selection procedures such as false discovery rate thresholding (FDRT). In the most challenging RW settings, HCT uses an unconventionally low threshold; this keeps the missed-feature detection rate under better control than FDRT and yields a classifier with improved misclassification performance. Replacing cross-validated threshold selection in the popular Shrunken Centroid classifier with the computationally less expensive and simpler HCT reduces the variance of the selected threshold and the error rate of the constructed classifier. Results on standard real datasets and in asymptotic theory confirm the advantages of HCT.},

abstract = {This paper is about a curious phenomenon. Suppose we have a data matrix, which is the superposition of a low-rank component and a sparse component. Can we recover each component individually? We prove that under some suitable assumptions, it is possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by solving a very convenient convex program called Principal Component Pursuit; among all feasible decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the L1 norm. This suggests the possibility of a principled approach to robust principal component analysis since our methodology and results assert that one can recover the principal components of a data matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted. This extends to the situation where a fraction of the entries are missing as well. We discuss an algorithm for solving this optimization problem, and present applications in the area of video surveillance, where our methodology allows for the detection of objects in a cluttered background, and in the area of face recognition, where it offers a principled way of removing shadows and specularities in images of faces.},

abstract = {In recent years, many methods have been developed for regression in high-dimensional settings. We propose covariance-regularized regression, a family of methods that use a shrunken estimate of the inverse covariance matrix of the features in order to achieve superior prediction. An estimate of the inverse covariance matrix is obtained by maximizing its log likelihood, under a multivariate normal model, subject to a constraint on its elements; this estimate is then used to estimate coefficients for the regression of the response onto the features. We show that ridge regression, the lasso, and the elastic net are special cases of covariance-regularized regression, and we demonstrate that certain previously unexplored forms of covariance-regularized regression can outperform existing methods in a range of situations. The covariance-regularized regression framework is extended to generalized linear models and linear discriminant analysis, and is used to analyze gene expression data sets with multiple class and survival outcomes.},

abstract = {Low-rank matrix approximations, such as the truncated singular value decomposition and the rank-revealing QR decomposition, play a central role in data analysis and scientific computing. This work surveys and extends recent research which demonstrates that randomization offers a powerful tool for performing low-rank matrix approximation. These techniques exploit modern computational architectures more fully than classical methods and open the possibility of dealing with truly massive data sets. This paper presents a modular framework for constructing randomized algorithms that compute partial matrix decompositions. These methods use random sampling to identify a subspace that captures most of the action of a matrix. The input matrix is then compressed—either explicitly or implicitly—to this subspace, and the reduced matrix is manipulated deterministically to obtain the desired low-rank factorization. In many cases, this approach beats its classical competitors in terms of accuracy, robustness, and/or spee...},

@article{Eklund2012,
abstract = {The validity of parametric functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis has only been reported for simulated data. Recent advances in computer science and data sharing make it possible to analyze large amounts of real fMRI data. In this study, 1484 rest datasets have been analyzed in SPM8, to estimate true familywise error rates. For a familywise significance threshold of 5\%, significant activity was found in 1\%-70\% of the 1484 rest datasets, depending on repetition time, paradigm and parameter settings. This means that parametric significance thresholds in SPM both can be conservative or very liberal. The main reason for the high familywise error rates seems to be that the global AR(1) auto correlation correction in SPM fails to model the spectra of the residuals, especially for short repetition times. The findings that are reported in this study cannot be generalized to parametric fMRI analysis in general, and other software packages may give different results. By using the computational power of the graphics processing unit (GPU), the 1484 rest datasets were also analyzed with a random permutation test. Significant activity was then found in 1\%-19\% of the datasets. These findings speak to the need for a better model of temporal correlations in fMRI timeseries.},

abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) represent a formidable challenge for psychiatry and neuroscience because of their high prevalence, lifelong nature, complexity and substantial heterogeneity. Facing these obstacles requires large-scale multidisciplinary efforts. Although the field of genetics has pioneered data sharing for these reasons, neuroimaging had not kept pace. In response, we introduce the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)—a grassroots consortium aggregating and openly sharing 1112 existing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) data sets with corresponding structural MRI and phenotypic information from 539 individuals with ASDs and 573 age-matched typical controls (TCs; 7–64 years) (http://fcon\_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/). Here, we present this resource and demonstrate its suitability for advancing knowledge of ASD neurobiology based on analyses of 360 male subjects with ASDs and 403 male age-matched TCs. We focused on whole-brain intrinsic functional connectivity and also survey a range of voxel-wise measures of intrinsic functional brain architecture. Whole-brain analyses reconciled seemingly disparate themes of both hypo- and hyperconnectivity in the ASD literature; both were detected, although hypoconnectivity dominated, particularly for corticocortical and interhemispheric functional connectivity. Exploratory analyses using an array of regional metrics of intrinsic brain function converged on common loci of dysfunction in ASDs (mid- and posterior insula and posterior cingulate cortex), and highlighted less commonly explored regions such as the thalamus. The survey of the ABIDE R-fMRI data sets provides unprecedented demonstrations of both replication and novel discovery. By pooling multiple international data sets, ABIDE is expected to accelerate the pace of discovery setting the stage for the next generation of ASD studies.},
